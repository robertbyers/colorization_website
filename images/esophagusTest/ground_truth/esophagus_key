Image 1:In this survey image, a portion of the wall of the esophagus is shown.  Note the lumen at the top, the stratified squamous non-keratinized epithelium of the mucosa and the underlying connective tissue of the submucosa.

Image 2:At high power, nuclei are evident in the outermost squamous cells, hence the designation - stratified squamous, non-keratinized epithelium.

Image 3:The connective tissue subjacent to the epithelium consists of a thin layer of loose connective tissue in contact with the epithelium and the dense irregularly arranged connective tissue of the submucosa.  The muscularis mucosa is not visible in this image.
