Image 1: Human kidney: simple squamous and simple cuboidal epithelium

Image 2: In this high-power image, a portion of a renal corpuscle and adjacent renal tubules are shown.  The renal corpuscle consists of the glomerulus (capillary network derived from afferent arteriole) and Bowman's capsule.  The glomerulus contains endothelium, simple squamous cells that constitute the capillary and are not readily visible here.  The glomerulus is within Bowman's space, which is delineated by a simple squamous epithelium whose dark-staining nuclei are evident.

Image 3: The renal tubules surrounding the renal corpuscles are portions of proximal and distal tubules lined with a simple cuboidal epithelium.
