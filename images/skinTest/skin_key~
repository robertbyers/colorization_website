Image 1: In this low-power survey image of skin, the epidermis is at the top of the image.  Subjacent to the epidermis is the dense irregularly arranged connective tissue of the dermis.  The hypodermis lies beneath and contains adipose tissue, visible in this faded image as a clear space at bottom.

Image 2: A higher-power view of the dermis shows the irregular arrangement of the eosinophilic collagen fibers beneath the keratinized stratified squamous epithelium of the epidermis.

Image 3: At similar magnification, the interface of the dermis and hypodermis reveals a patch of adipose tissue.  The adipose cells have the appearance of a �honey comb� network.

Image 4: Another higher-magnification view of the hypodermis shows a large blood vessel cut in partial longitudinal section and the secretory portion of an eccrine sweat gland embedded in adipose tissue.
