LYMPH NODE RETICULAR TISSUE

Image 1: A low-power image of a lymph node stained using silver impregnation methods reveals the delicate reticular fiber network of this lymphoid structure.  The capsule is at upper right with several lymphoid nodules beneath.

Image 2: A higher-power view shows the reticular fibers surrounded by numerous lymphocytes.

Image 3: At high magnification, the reticular fibers are more clearly seen.  Careful inspection at this magnification sometimes reveals reticular cells, specialized fibroblasts that cling to the fibrous network they produce.
